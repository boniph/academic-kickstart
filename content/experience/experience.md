Tasks:
   * Identification, DNA extraction and amplification of polychaetes sampled by box-corer 
   * Ecological analysis on R (diversity estimators, constrained ordination, species range, betadiversity)  

<br> **Aims of the first publication (1) to test the hypotheses that support spatial conservation planning in the CCFZ, particularly the environmental drivers of alpha and beta diversity such as organic carbon fluxes to the seafloor and nodule density; (2) to assess the representativeness of an APEI (i.e., APEI no. 3); and (3) to improve the assessment of potential risks of biodiversity loss due to nodule mining.**
