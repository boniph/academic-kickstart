About 90% of deep-sea polychaetes from the CCFZ are new for science (Glover et al., 2002). The main goal of this project is to describe as much as I can along next years. 

Until now, I have described 19 species with one for coastal waters and 18 for deep-sea. 17 from the CCFZ and one from hydrothermal vents.
