According to [MIDAS website](https://www.eu-midas.net/about), the partnership comprises 32 organisations from across Europe, including research institutes, universities, specialist SMEs and industry partners. This partnership brings together a wealth of scientific expertise in deep-sea biology, ecology, biochemistry, oceanography, geology and geochemistry to work alongside specialists in marine policy, environmental regulation and legislation. A critical component of the partnership is the expertise in deep-sea exploitation operations and technologies brought by our industry partners, who will also drive the engagement with other commercial stakeholders in the offshore sector.

MIDAS has an ambitious set of objectives, aimed at building the knowledge base to underpin sound environmental policies in relation to deep-sea exploitation:
1. To identify the scale of possible impacts, and their duration, on deep-sea ecosystems associated with different types of resource extraction activities;
2. To develop workable solutions and best practice codes for environmentally sound and socially acceptable commercial activities;
3. To develop cost-effective technologies for monitoring the impacts of mineral exploitation and the subsequent recovery of ecosystems;
4. To work with policy makers in the European and international arenas to enshrine best practice in international and national regulations and overarching legal frameworks.
