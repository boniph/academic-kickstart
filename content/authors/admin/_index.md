I was a PhD student at Université de Bordeaux and co-supervised at UPMC Université Paris 06 (Sorbonne Université). During my PhD, the principal focus was the ecology and diversity of macrobenthic communities at different spatial and temporal scales in the Mediterranean Sea. My research elucidated ecological responses in macrobenthos communities to changes caused by hydrological regime (i.e. Rhône River) and climate changes (i.e. Bay of Banyuls-sur-Mer and Gulf of Lions).<br> Recently, I have finished two post-doc positions at Ifremer where I concentrated effort across the nodule province of CCFZ: (a) describing the diversity patterns and community composition of polychaete assemblages; and (b) describing species and reclassifying the polynoids subfamilies.<br> Now, I'm launching myself as consultant for taxonomic polychaete identification, scientific writing and [more...](#expertise)
